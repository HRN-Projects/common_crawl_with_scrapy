Code can be executed in two ways -

1. Enter scrapy crawl command :
	a. Go to "scrapy_code\ccFetch\."
	b. Open cmd/terminal
	c. Type command - "scrapy crawl ccrawl -o cnn_data.xlsx -a domain=cnn.com"

2. Use a python script:
	a. Go to "scrapy_code\ccFetch\."
	b. Open cmd/terminal
	c. Type command - "python run_prog.py"
	d. Enter the required information and the code execution will start.

Note :
	1. "-o" was used for passing output file name to crawler.
	2. "-a" was used to pass any expected argument (domain, in this case).
